# fuzzy-matching
This is a fuzzy search matching proof of concept project. It demonstrates through unit tests the viability of implementing a fuzzy/partial matching algorithm. This is a simple 
and quick algorithm, implementing various searching techniques and calculating an average based on the results. If the average is `>=` to the minimum ratio, the result is deemed similar enough.

## Running
* Compile: `mvn compile`
